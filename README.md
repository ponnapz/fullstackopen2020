## Full Stack Open 2020

Having been a backend developer throughout my career, I've always wanted to learn a bit of frontend development as well.
Few months back I read about [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) in reddit and was intrigued. 

I'm now starting on the course and this repository will hold the exercises (and anything else that's related) to the course.
